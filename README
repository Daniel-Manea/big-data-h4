# Running Your Application with Docker Compose

## Overview

This Docker Compose setup allows you to run your application in a containerized environment. Docker Compose simplifies the process of defining and managing the services required for your application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine.

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. To run the containers in the background, use:
    ```
    docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate```

3. Access your application:

    Your application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:your_port`. Replace `your_port` with the actual port specified in your Docker Compose configuration.

## Additional Information

- Learn more about Docker: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- Docker Compose is included with Docker. Ensure you have Docker installed: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
