Certainly! Here's the revised README to accurately reflect that Docker Compose comes bundled with Docker:

# Running Your Application with Docker Compose

## Overview

This Docker Compose setup allows you to run your application in a containerized environment. Docker Compose simplifies the process of defining and managing the services required for your application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine.

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Customize the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your application's requirements.

4. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```

5. Run the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To run the containers in the background, use:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

6. Access your application:

    Your application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:your_port`. Replace `your_port` with the actual port specified in your Docker Compose configuration.

7. To stop the containers, use:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
